# FizzBuzz Tests

This project contains SpecFlow tests exercising the FizzBuzz application. The BDD spec test definitions live within the `FizzBuzz.feature` file. The test steps used by the feature file are defined in `FizzBuzzSteps.cs` and the test state is controlled via the `FizzBuzzContext.cs`.

## Usage

The tests can be ran directly from Visual Studio by running the Test Explorer against the BackendCodingChallenge.FizzBuzz.Tests project.

It can also be executed from a terminal by navigating to BackendCodingChallenge\BackendCodingChallenge.FizzBuzz.Tests and running `dotnet test`.
