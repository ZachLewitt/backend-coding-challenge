# FizzBuzz

## Requirements

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, with each on a new line. For multiples of 3, instead of printing the number, print “Fizz”; for multiples of five, print “Buzz”; for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”.

## Usage

The program can be ran directly from Visual Studio by running or debugging the **BackendCodingChallenge.FizzBuzz.App** project. With this approach you may need to add a breakpoint to the end of `Program.cs` to see the output before the console disappears.

It can also be executed from a terminal by navigating to BackendCodingChallenge\BackendCodingChallenge.FizzBuzz.App and running `dotnet run`.
