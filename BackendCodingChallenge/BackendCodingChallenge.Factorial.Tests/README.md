# Factorial Tests

This project contains SpecFlow tests exercising the Factorial application. The BDD spec test definitions live within the `Factorial.feature` file. The test steps used by the feature file are defined in `FactorialSteps.cs` and the test state is controlled via the `FactorialContext.cs`.

## Usage

The tests can be ran directly from Visual Studio by running the Test Explorer against the BackendCodingChallenge.Factorial.Tests project.

It can also be executed from a terminal by navigating to BackendCodingChallenge\BackendCodingChallenge.Factorial.Tests and running `dotnet test`.
