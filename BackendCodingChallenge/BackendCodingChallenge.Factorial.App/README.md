# Factorial

## Requirements

Write a program that allows a user to enter a number, and then calculate the factorial of that number and print it on screen. Your program should accept and validate user input, find the factorial and print the answer.

## Usage

The program can be ran directly from Visual Studio by running or debugging the **BackendCodingChallenge.Factorial.App** project.

It can also be executed from a terminal by navigating to BackendCodingChallenge\BackendCodingChallenge.Factorial.App and running `dotnet run`.
